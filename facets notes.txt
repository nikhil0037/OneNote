Eligibiity (w.r.t claims)
-------------------------
Member is active
Member paid the premium
whether the treatment was given or not
Whether the treatment is covered in the policy
Whether the SI is already met
Whether Duplicate Claim

Sum Insured ==> 3L
P1 - M1 - 2nd - Mbr C1 -- 1L --> IC Pays
     M1 - 4th - Mbr C2 -- 2L --> IC Pays
     M1 - 9th - Mbr C3 -- 50K --> IC will not pay

Pre-existing Conditions
------------------------
A condition for which the individual received medical care prior to the effective date of Coverage.

P1 -- Covers Heart Disease (Pre Existing Condition Excluded)

M1 - joins the policy P1 on 01/1/2022, he is healthy person
	04/1/2022, he has a heart problem for the first time
	Policy P1 covers the expenses.

M2 - joins the policy P1 on 1/1/2022, he is taking treatment for heart problem from 01/01/2021
	and on 5/1/2022, he has a heart problem again
	Policy P1 does not cover the expenses


Before member joins the policy, if already they have tat health issue then for that condition treatment 
cost will not be covered.

Network -- Collection of Providers
Network Group -- Collection of Networks
Network Set/Superset of all the Networks -- Collection of Network Group

In Network -- Provider is in tie up/Contract with the IC

Out of Network -- Provider will not be in tie up/contract with the IC

PCP (Primary Care Physician) -- Gatekeeper

Provider Payment method
------------------------

Fee For Service (FFS) -- Provider gets paid for all the services, traditional method which was followed.
				-- Unnecesary treatment
				-- HC COst increased
				-- Loss for IC

Capitation -- Risk Sharing Arrangement

Based on how many ever members are enrolled under tat particular Provider, the payment happens
Per Member Per Month (PMPM) -- $2000

Prov1		($2000 per month for per member)

 Jan -  10 Enrolled members -- $2000*10 = $20000
 Feb - 5 Enrolled members   -- $2000*5  = $10000
 Mar - 15 Enrolled members  -- $2000*15 = $30000

Jan 
	M1 - Healthy -- No visit to the provider
	IC pays $2000 to the Provider
	IC - Loss of $2000
	Provider - Profit of $2000

	M2 - went for some service for $5000
	IC pays $2000 to the Provider
	IC - Profit of $3000
	Provider - Loss of $3000

Provider will not provider unnecessary
Focus on preventive and wellness programs
-----------------------------------------
Education
Vaccination
Diet 
Camp
Counselling

This capitation method is very useful for IC, as it tries to reduce the HC cost and also ensures good
treatment to the members.

Cost Shifting
-------------
The loss from one member is compensated by the profit from another member

Max allowed amount ==> Maximum amount the IC will pay for a particular service


COB (Co-ordination of Benefit) -- Non duplication of Benefits
---------------------------------------------------------------

Mom -- has a policy -- Kid Covered as a dependent -- $6000
Dad -- has a policy -- Kid Covered as a dependent -- $4000

Kid -- gets a treatment -- $8000

Mom policy pays = $6000
Dad Policy Pays = $4000
               ----------
		  $10000 > $8000

Mom - Her policy will be the Primary coverage for the kid
Dad - His policy will be secondary and mom's policy will be primary

Mom Policy Pays = $6000
Dad policy pays = ($8000-$6000=$2000)
		- Min ($4000, $2000)= $2000
		--------
		  $8000 <= total treatment cost

Kid -- gets a treatment -- $12000

Mom - $6000
Dad - ($12000-$6000) = $6000 = $4000
      ---------
      $10000 <= Total treatment cost

PBM - Pharmacy Benefit Management

EDI -- Electronic Data Interchange

EOB - Explanation of Benefit

Copay -- Fixed amount paid by the member at the time of treatment for a particular service. eg: Consultation fee

Coinsurance -- Financial responsibility shared by Member and Insurance Company. 90% (90% of the total cost
will be paid by the IC and 10% will be paid by the member)

Deductible -- Flat dollar amount that needs to met before the IC starts paying for any service for a particular benefit period.

Benefit Period - Calendar Year/Plan Year

OOP (Out of Pocket) expenses -- Copay+Coinsurance+Deductible

OOP Max-- $3000 for a benefit period 
OOP Lifetime -- $999999999 

Medicare - Older age>65
Medicaid - Low income ppl

EDI - Electronic Data Interchange

HMOs offer lower costs but limited provider choice. 
PPOs provide more flexibility with higher expenses, especially for out-of-network care. 
EPOs offer moderate costs with strict in-network usage, except for emergencies

Flexibility when choosing providers and locations, a PPO plan may better fit your needs. 
An EPO plan may be a better option if you want the flexibility of a larger network, but don't necessarily need out-of-network benefits.

EPO Benefits
------------
EPO health insurance offers some benefits like those we get from a PPO and HMO health plan, like flexibility and lower costs. Advantages of an EPO plan include: No referrals needed. Usually no requirement to choose a primary care provider. Generally lower out-of-pocket costs than a PPO plan

POS: An affordable plan with out-of-network coverage
For slightly higher premiums than an HMO, this plan does cover out-of-network doctors. But you'll pay more. This is an important difference if you are managing a condition and one or more of your doctors are not in the network

Hierarchy
----------
IPA
Provider Group
Practitioner/Facility

participating/in-n/w ==> they have an agreement with the IC

Provider Group ==> Set of Providers join together and form a group (Practitioner and Facility)

IPA ==> Practitioner/PG/Hospital
IC will have tie up with the IPA

Agreement --> What are the services, POS, cost for each service
So the pricing (the allowed amount) will be derived.

Network - Collection of Providers
Network Set - Collection of Network group -- Superset of all networks

Network Set will be mapped to the class/plan definition 
In product level the benefits is same for all these provider in these Networks, hence mapping the Network set in class/plan definition.

To identify the provider status, we need to compare NWPR and NWST tables

Comparison Logic
------------------
Compare NWNW_ID + NWPR_PFX from NWST with NWNW_ID + NWPR_PFX from NWPR
	If Match Exists Then
		If the status Indicator from Matching row of NWST Table is 'I' then
			Provider in the claim is INN Provider
				If PCP Ind of matching row from NWPR Table is 'Y' and if the provider is added/mapped as Mbr's PCP during enrollment then
					Provider in the claim is "PCP" Provider
				Else
					Provider in the claim is "Specialist" Provider
		Else if the status Ind from Matching row of NWST Table is 'P' then
			Provider in the claim is "Participating" Provider
	Else
		Provider in the claim is "OON" Provider

Service Conversion Process
----------------------------
We derive Service ID/Service Code/Type Of Service based on Procedure Code, Revenue Code, Diag Code and other parameters.

Service ID is a stage by stage derivation based on which we will be able to identify the Max allowable amount
or the Pricing Amount.

Benefit Amount = Max allowed Amt - OOP - COB (If any)

Service ID is must and it should be correct 

General Prerequisite --> establish all the Service ID applicable in the system...

Service ID Description Application (SEDS) --> List all the possible Service IDs

select * from CMC_SEDS_SE_DESC

Service Conversion Process --> 3 Step Process

Step 1: Basic Conversion Process (TPCT Prefix) --> Mandatory for Medical Products

  1) Service Code Conversion Process (SECT) --> Among the available Service IDs, we pick handfull of services that are applicable/make it available for your Product.

  2) Service Procedure Conversion (TPCT) -- Mapping Procedurec code along with Modifiers to its equivalent Service ID
 
  3) Service Revenue Conversion (RCCT) -- Mapping Revenue code to its equivalent Service ID

select * from CMC_SEDS_SE_DESC

SELECT * FROM CMC_SECT_CONV
SELECT * FROM CMC_TPCT_CPT_CONV
SELECT * FROM CMC_RCCT_CONV
we create the prefix '0001' in Service Conversion Description application and the same will be listed in the
Class/plan definition drop down option (TCPT Prefix)

Step 2: Supplemental Conversion Rules -- we create Qualifier Groups --> Criteria to pick the claim

1) Create Qualifier Group (Supplemental Conv Qualifier Group Application)

eg: QG1 --> Group ID = GR1
            and
  	    Subgroup ID =  SG1
	    and
	    PRPR_ID = PR1

if this is the criteria, then the Service ID = VO

eg: Same qualifier and Different Qualifier

Assocaite ID		Designation		End Result
-----------------------------------------------------------
123456 or 345678   				Max 2 rows 
123456 and 345678			        0
123456         or        SA			Many
123456         And       SA			1 row

2) Supplement Procedure Conversion Rules (SPCR)

   Mapping Procedure Code based QG --> Service ID

3) Supplemental Revenue Conversion Rules (SRCR)

   Mapping Revenue Code based QG --> Service ID

Step 3: Supplemental Conversion Process

Supp Proc code Conv (SPCT) -> Based on Service ID from Step1, consider Proc code, Modifier, Age, Gender, POS, Dig code, prov type, speciality -> Exact Service ID

Supp Rev code Conv (SRCT) -> Based on Service ID from Step1, consider Revenue code, Age, Gender, POS, Dig code, prov type, Bill code -> Exact Service ID

Service Payment (SEPY)
----------------------

indirectly defines the Copay and Coinsurance
We map it in the Product Variable component

Map Service ID --> Service Rule (SESE)
		      |
		    Define Copay/Coinsurance based on Service Tier (SETR)
			Tier can be set up based on 3 types
				Amount
				Counter
				Disallow (Entire line item will be disallowed and the Benefit Amt = 0)


Soham (project)
	VO -> SEP1
	VO -> 001 
	$1000 - Copay $10 Coinsurance 90%
	$2000 - $5000 - Copay $5 Coinsurance 95%
	$6000 -  Copay $0 Coinsurance 100%


Vedhika (Project)
	VO -> SEP2
	SEP2 002 
	First 5 visits - Copay $15 coinsurance 95%
	6 - 10 - Copay $10 Coinsurance 100%
	11 - 999 - Copay $0 Coinsurance 100%

Devanshish (Project)
	VO -> SEP3
	SEP3 003 Copay $5 Coinsurance 100%


For disallow we don't need any Service Tier as the entire row will be disallowed.

	Service Penalty (SESP) ->
				% amount
				Flat AMount
				Lessor of (Derived Penalty , Penalty Limit) -> Final Penalty

	Service Related Parameter (SERL) -> we define extra things like weightage factor for service ID,
					define n/w

SESP and SERL are not mandatory

A claim goes through different status during processing
• 01 – Accepted – When a claim is successfully adjudicated
• 11/15 – Pended – When a claim is pended and is waiting for a user to correct error and/or release pend.
• 02 – Paid/Finalized – When a claim is finalized and payment is completed
• 91 – Adjusted – When a paid claim is adjusted. A claim can go to 91 status only from 02 status.
• 99 – Closed – When the claim is closed and no further action can be taken
• 16 -- Batch processing

ACCOUNTING/ACCOUNTING DATA MODEL
---------------------------------

Configuration application for Accounting 
Implementation application for Accounting

Rounding off --> Something which is not carried over for the next transaction

YOu purchase things and bill amount is $84

What are the possible outcomes to pay this bill??

1) Paying $90 --> getting back $6 : Settled
2) Paying $90 --> No change --> take someother item: Settled
3) Paying $90 --> No change --> you will purchase something next time : $6 with the shopekeeper
4) Paying $80 --> $4 has to be still paid by you.

In scenario 3: You paid in excess => Overpayment
In scenario 4: YOu paid in shortage => Underpayment

The overpayment/underpayment amount will get adjusted during the next purchase

PRPR --Submit--> CLCL --to--> PYPY --> reviews the claim --> Payment
						|
					Check previous outstanding
					(Adjustements -- OVerpayment/Underpayment)



Accounting Application group (4 key application)

1) Bank Account
	Payer's bank account details (PYBA)
		Account no:, Address of the Bank...

	If Payer prints the cheque --> we need other info apart from acctn no: -- Routing Transit Control Number

	||'000777'||'6868767868|:43434||'

2) Payor
	Associating the bank details to a Payor

In health insurance, A Payer in general can have many businesss
	Health Insurance: Payer --> have its own bank account(s)
	Life Insurance:	  Payer --> have its own bank account(s)

3) Accounting Period
	Time period : Start and End Date for Calculation
			Calendar year/Plan year

Scenario 1: At LOBD - Combine all claims to Provider -- No Claim Adjustment

1) Claim to Check Mapping
	Claim --> Equivalent Check no:

	CLCL --> CLCK 

	CLCL1 -- CKPY1
	CLCL2 -- CKPY1
	CLCL3 -- CKPY2

2) Claim Check --> Check payment Summary

	CLCK --> CKPY (hold the actual $ amount)
	
	CLCK --> CKPY1 -->$200
		 CKPY2 -->$100

3) Check Payment Summary --> Check 

	CKPY --> CKCK 
		  |
		 PYPY (PYBA)+ACPE+LOBD

4) Check Indicative and Check Status
	CKID		 CKST
 Provider Name/Address


Claim ending in 00 is referred to as original claim

Considering a claim has been paid incorrectly, instead of $50, $100 was paid.

Scenario 2  At LOBD - Combine all claims to Provider with Claim Adjustment

1) Claim to Check Mapping
	Claim --> Equivalent Check no:

	CLCL --> CLCK 

	CLCL1 -- CKPY1
	CLCL2 -- CKPY1
	CLCL3 -- CKPY2

2) Claim Check --> Check payment Summary

	CLCK --> CKPY (hold the actual $ amount)
	
	CLCK --> CKPY1 -->$200
		 CKPY2 -->$100

	a) CLCL --> CLOV (overpay amount is stored and mapped with ACPR)
 
	b) CLOV & ACPR --> CKPY = ACRH (manual Reduction)

3) Check Payment Summary --> Check 

	CKPY --> CKCK

BATCH PROCESSING
----------------

Core Batch jobs - N no: of Core batch jobs.==> Product build functionalities
Custom Batch jobs ==> Client specific jobs

Batch jobs are executed from Application Server

HOsted Client
Licensed Client

Batch Components placed in NAS Path

2 set of Servers
-----------------
Prod
Non Prod

Keyword files as input to the batch jobs

Operational Reference Manuals (ORM) for Facets Core batch jobs only ==> give the details on the step by step process and each step what tables are referred,
tables/fields updated

Customer Exchange


Region Overview:

Env dev QA SIT

Basic configuration to establish a region are:
1 DB
1 or more Application Servers
1 set of Config files

Default Region
---------------

Core Batch Components
----------------------

Region File --> System Config file (Stored in region folder)
 
Runbook ==> Stored in custom directory and it has job level processing instructions

Region file --> I/P path --> Path1
Runbook     --> I/P path --> Path2

Procedure File ==> Actual code


The input file will be in EDI but the Facets job accepts only keyword files.
HIPPA Gateway helps converting EDI file to Keyword file.

HIPAA Gateway --> Inbound/outbound

Inbound --> Accepts I/P file from external Vendor and creates keyword files for Facets

Outbound --> The files from Facets need to be converted to EDI file to be sent to the Vendor

EDI 834 ==> Membership data

EDI 837I --> Institutional Claim/hospital
EDI 837P --> Professional Claim/Medical
EDI 837D --> Dental Claims
